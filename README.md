# ESP-07 Wiegand MITM Tool

A compact Wi-Fi-enabled man-in-the-middle (MITM) device for the Wiegand protocol, designed using an ESP-07 microcontroller. 
This tool supports sniffing, spoofing, replay, and DoS attacks against RFID readers and controllers using the Wiegand interface.

## üîß How It Works

The ESP-07 Wiegand MITM device operates as a bridge between the RFID reader and the access control panel:
- Intercepts Wiegand data sent from the reader
- Logs and stores tag data with timestamps
- Allows manual spoofing and automated replay of RFID tags
- Launches DoS attacks by flooding the line with noise
- Hosts a web interface for real-time control and data visualization

Initially prototyped on an Arduino Uno for validation, the project moved to the ESP-07 for 3.3V logic compatibility and Wi-Fi support.

# ESP-07 Firmware Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the Arduino IDE, installing dependencies, and flashing the ESP-07 module.

&nbsp;
## 1. Setting Up Arduino IDE 2.x

### Install the ESP8266 Board Package
1. Open **Arduino IDE 2.x**.
2. Navigate to **File > Preferences**.
3. Add the following URL under **Additional Board Manager URLs**: `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`
4. Go to **Tools > Board > Board Manager**, search for `ESP8266`, and install it.

&nbsp;
### Install Required Libraries
Open the **Library Manager** (**Tools > Library Manager**) and install:

- **ArduinoJson** *(Benoit Blanchon)*  
Used for parsing and creating structured JSON data.

- **DNSServer** *(Part of ESP8266 core)*  
Included automatically; no separate installation needed.

- **ESP8266WiFi** *(Part of ESP8266 core)*  
Handles Wi-Fi operations (AP/STA modes).

&nbsp;
### Install Asynchronous Networking Libraries (Manual Installation)
These libraries must be installed manually:

&nbsp;
#### **ESPAsyncTCP**
1. Download from GitHub:  
[https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncTCP)
2. Extract and place the folder in your Arduino `libraries` directory:
- **Windows**: `Documents\Arduino\libraries\ESPAsyncTCP`
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/Arduino/libraries/ESPAsyncTCP`

&nbsp;
#### **ESPAsyncWebServer**
1. Download from GitHub:  
[https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer](https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer)
2. Place the extracted folder in the same `libraries` directory.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: `ESPAsyncWebServer` requires both `ESPAsyncTCP` and `ESP8266WiFi`.

&nbsp;
### Restart Arduino IDE
After installation, restart the IDE to apply changes.

&nbsp;

## 2. Flashing the ESP-07

### Uploading the Sketch
1. Open `espRFID.ino` in Arduino IDE.
2. Place the `data` folder (containing HTML/scripts) in the same directory as the sketch.
3. Connect the ESP-07 via an **ESP8266Burn debugger**.
4. Select the correct **ESP8266 board** and **COM port** in the IDE.
5. Upload the sketch.

&nbsp;
### Uploading Files to LittleFS
To upload the `data` folder to the ESP-07's filesystem:

&nbsp;
#### Install the LittleFS Uploader Plugin
1. Download the plugin `.vsix` file from:  [Releases Page](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-littlefs-upload/releases/download/1.5.3/arduino-littlefs-upload-1.5.3.vsix)
2. Place the file in:
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\.arduinoIDE\plugins\`
- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.arduinoIDE/plugins/` (create the folder if missing).
3. Restart Arduino IDE.
4. Verify installation by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + P** and searching for:   **`Upload Little FS to Pico/ESP8266/ESP32`**.

&nbsp;
#### Upload Files
- Use the command above to upload the `data` folder contents to LittleFS.

&nbsp;

## Configuration via `secrets.h`

The `secrets.h` file contains sensitive and customizable parameters for the ESP-07. **You must modify this file** before flashing the firmware to match your environment. Below are the key configurations:

&nbsp;
### 1. **Wi-Fi Credentials**
The ESP-07 operates in **dual mode**:
- **STA (Station) Mode**: Connects to your local Wi-Fi network for debugging/internal communication.
- **AP (Access Point) Mode**: Creates a fallback Wi-Fi network if STA mode fails (e.g., no Wi-Fi available).

&nbsp;

#### **Local Wi-Fi (STA Mode)**
- Replace these with your home/office network credentials:
```cpp
#define LOCAL_SSID "MyWiFiNetwork"    // Your Wi-Fi SSID
#define LOCAL_PASS "password1234"     // Your Wi-Fi password
```
- If connection fails, the ESP-07 switches to AP mode automatically.


&nbsp;

#### **Access Point (AP Mode)**
Predefined fallback network (change if needed):
```cpp
#define AP_SSID "ESP-07-Access-Point"  // Default AP SSID
#define AP_PASS "123456789"             // Default AP password
```
Devices can connect to this network to access the ESP-07‚Äôs web interface at `http://192.168.1.1`.


&nbsp;

## Security Notes

- üîí Change the default `AP_SSID` and `AP_PASS` in production.
- üì∂ If STA mode fails, the ESP-07 remains accessible via AP mode for configuration.

## Final Thoughts

This started as a weekend experiment with an Arduino and grew into something unexpectedly useful. The ESP-07 turned out to be a perfect fit ‚Äì its 3.3V logic plays nice with Wiegand systems, and Wi-Fi control makes testing way easier.

&nbsp;

**What I like most:**
- Spoofing/replay works surprisingly well on older installations
- The heatmap actually helped me spot shift patterns at my lab‚Äôs door
- **How satisfying it is to see your own spoofed tag** unlock a door (with permission, of course!)

&nbsp;

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Just a Friendly Warning

I built this to learn about RFID systems ‚Äì **not to break into places**. Messing with security systems without permission will:
1. Probably get you fired
2. Maybe get you arrested
3. Definitely void warranties
    
Use responsibly!
